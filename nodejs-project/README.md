This project is inherited for [Noodejs-Sample](https://github.com/jmhdez/Nodejs-Sample)

I want to use git clone, but he submit the node_modules to the repo... so I just copy it. If something is wrong please tell me.


This is just a sample app to play with:

* [node.js](http://nodejs.org)
* [express](http://expressjs.com/) as web server
* [jade](http://jade-lang.com/) as view engine
* [jQuery](http://jquery.org) as client side technology
